Material Slot Visibility is a Blender add-on that provides fine control over the visibility of individual material slots on mesh objects. 
It allows you to toggle each material slotâ€™s visibility separately for both the viewport and render, 
and fully supports animation through keyframes. This is especially useful for creating layered material effects, progressive reveals, or managing complex materials in scenes without modifying geometry or shaders
